Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: qcom: ipq8074: correct PCIe QMP PHY output clock
 names

Current PCIe QMP PHY output name were changed in ("arm64: dts: qcom: Fix
IPQ8074 PCIe PHY nodes") however it did not account for the fact that GCC
driver is relying on the old names to match them as they are being used as
the parent for the gcc_pcie0_pipe_clk and gcc_pcie1_pipe_clk.

This broke parenting as GCC could not find the parent clock, so fix it by
changing to the names that driver is expecting.
